Well BizStrap provides the same Screen, Form, Menu and related widgets but now rendering Bootstrap ready HTML. \r\n\r\n### No Modules?\r\nThat's right. We have been developing OFBiz based applications for a while since we liked the simplicity. However, were always pained buy the interlinked modules many of which we didn't really need. So, we made an attempt to retain the bare bones and strip off everything else so that you can write your own application without the unwanted baggage of modules that hang around only to satisfy the dependency. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with setup/installation?
